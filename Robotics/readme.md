* Most existing robot learning benchmarks struggle to address real-world challenges caused by low-quality data and limited sensing capabilities, typically limited to short-horizon tasks within controlled environments.
* Introducing **AgiBot World**, the first **large-scale robotic learning dataset** designed to advance **multi-purpose humanoid robotic policies**.
* It is to be accompanied by **foundation models**, **benchmarks**, and an **ecosystem** to democratize access to high-quality robot data for the academic community and the industry, paving the path towards the "ImageNet Moment" for Embodied AI.
* With **1M+ trajectories from 100 robots**, AgiBot World spans 100+ real-world scenarios across **five target domains**, tackling fine-grained manipulation, tool usage, and **multi-robot collaboration**.
* Cutting-edge multimodal hardware features **visual tactile sensors**, **durable 6-DoF dexterous hands**, and **mobile dual-arm robots** with **whole-body control**, supporting research in imitation learning, multi-agent collaboration, and more.
* AgiBot World aspires to transform large-scale robot learning and advance scalable robotic systems for production.
* This **open-source platform** invites researchers and practitioners to collaboratively shape the future of Embodied AI.
